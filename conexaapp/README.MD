> **About API**:

- The endpoint `/api/login` does not return the user id. So in the endpoint `/api/consulta` method `POST`, the `idMedico` field contains the value 12 defined statically.
- The endpoint `/api/consulta` method `POST`, does not really include the new appointment into your data base. Then the home screen listing will not be updated.
- The endpoint `/api/consultas` method `GET` was not paginated, so there was no implementation of infinite scroll.
